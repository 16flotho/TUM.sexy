### How to add/update links?
This is damn easy, man! Just do it!
- Fork this repo
- Open the file /redirect/routes.php
- Make your updates in the JSON-formatted routing rules
- Open a Pull Request via GitHub

##### And then? :scream:
- After we merged it, the changes get automagically deployed via a webhook
- The list on the frontpage (tum.sexy) updates automagically aswell :sunglasses:


Hint: the display:[true|false] field is used to determine whether this redirect should be displayed on the frontpage or not.
